# Congruence-analysis -- Swiss-Citizen-Initiated-Referendum


*Motivation :*

Beyond their results, citizen-initiated referendums may have indirect effects on legislators. 
Through them, citizens can draw their attention to a specific issue and get them to refocus and reposition themselves 
on it. We hypothesize that an increasing anchorage in such a system could, on the one hand, induce institutions to be 
more and more accountable to citizens' positions, aligning themselves with them, and, on the other hand, bring the 
issues raised by the referendum back to the political forefront (ex-post).

By focusing on such a well-established system of direct democracy in one country, Switzerland, we wish to study these 
issues through an analysis of the temporal evolution of the positioning of institutions in relation to that of citizens 
(through the study of referendum results) as well as an analysis of political discourses before and after referendums.


*Preliminary analysis :*

We propose here an initial analysis of the congruence aspect of our project, as it is the first step that can attest 
to the degree of relevance of our research project. These first results will allow a possible reframing of the questions,
the methods and the focus, and will open the way to a possible analysis of the discourse.
